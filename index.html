    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" id="canteen">The food options and rensponsibilities are to consider, as a student needs to have food for energy. We have a new variety of foods every year. Menus with detailed photograghs and description of the food. Each meal set will have the perfect amount of each food group so our students can stay healthy! Everything is online so we can keep track of what the students have ordered. It will indeed cost money to buy the food if you're in college level, but if not, you wouldnt have to pay for 2 meals everyday, but if you bring your own food, you would be restricted to have our food, but will save alot of money! And since its online, the paying method is much much easier to do, as its safer and much less complicated for both the students and our staff to handle.</p>
